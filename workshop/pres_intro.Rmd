## Networks: History & Terminology 
In this section we will discuss 
 
 1. A, very brief, history of network analysis in academic literature
    + Grannovetter (1978)
         . . . *forbidden tryads*
 
 2. Key terminology needed in discussing network attributes. 
    + Measures of centrality
        - Degree
        - Betweeness
        - Closeness
        
        
        
        

## History
Social networks have been a prominent part of sociological theory since the very beginning.

## History
In 1978, Mark Granovetter published his seminal paper, *The Strength of Weak Ties*, which introduced a concise and coherent theory of how information flows in networks.

  1. The **Forbidden tryad**
  
    [*definition*] If two people are connected to the same person, they are inherently connected.

## Graph Centrality

It is often helpful to identify key people or nodes in graphs. Specific individuals -- such as the company boss -- can be specified before hand with prior knowledge.

But, just because an individual is the boss -- and in a position of authority, they may not be influential within the network.

Measures of centraility help us better identify key nodes in a network graph. 

### An example
Suppose we have a network comprise of all group members in marketing company.  This group has 4 team leaders.  Looking at the graph below, which member is most closely connected to all others? 
```{r,echo=F}

nodes <- nodes %>% 
    mutate(value = rescale(igraph::eigen_centrality(g)$vector,2,15),
           centrality = ifelse(value == max(value),'Highest','Lowest'))

visNetwork::visNetwork(nodes,edges) %>% 
    visNodes(
        shape = "square",
        color = list(
            background = "lightblue",
            border = "darkblue",
            highlight = "yellow"
        ),
        shadow = list(enabled = TRUE, size = 10)
    )%>% 
    visInteraction(navigationButtons = TRUE) %>% 
    visOptions(highlightNearest = T,selectedBy = 'centrality')
```



## Degree

The degree of a graph vertex of a graph is the number of graph edges which touch.
```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,results='asis'}



nodes <- nodes %>% 
    mutate(value = rescale(igraph::degree(g),2,15),
           centrality = ifelse(value == max(value),'Highest','Lowest'))

visNetwork::visNetwork(nodes,edges) %>% 
    visNodes(
        shape = "square",
        color = list(
            background = "lightblue",
            border = "darkblue",
            highlight = "yellow"
        ),
        shadow = list(enabled = TRUE, size = 10)
    )%>% 
    visInteraction(navigationButtons = TRUE) %>% 
    visOptions(highlightNearest = T,selectedBy = 'centrality')






```






## Closeness

Closeness is the sum of the length of the shortest paths between the node and all other nodes in the graph. Thus the more central a node is, the closer it is to all other nodes.

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,results='asis'}

nodes <- nodes %>% 
    mutate(value = rescale(igraph::closeness(g),2,15),
           centrality = ifelse(value == max(value),'Highest','Lowest'))

visNetwork::visNetwork(nodes,edges) %>% 
    visNodes(
        shape = "square",
        color = list(
            background = "lightblue",
            border = "darkblue",
            highlight = "yellow"
        ),
        shadow = list(enabled = TRUE, size = 10)
    )%>% 
    visInteraction(navigationButtons = TRUE) %>% 
    visOptions(highlightNearest = T,selectedBy = 'centrality')


```







## Betweenness

The betweenness centrality for each vertex is the number of these shortest paths that pass through the vertex. 

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,results='asis'}


nodes <- nodes %>% 
    mutate(value = rescale(igraph::betweenness(g),2,15),
           centrality = ifelse(value == min(value),'Lowest','Highest'))

visNetwork::visNetwork(nodes,edges) %>% 
    visNodes(
        shape = "square",
        color = list(
            background = "lightblue",
            border = "darkblue",
            highlight = "yellow"
        ),
        shadow = list(enabled = TRUE, size = 10)
    )%>% 
    visInteraction(navigationButtons = TRUE) %>% 
    visOptions(highlightNearest = T,selectedBy = 'centrality')



```
