## What is R and why use it?

- Statistical programming language
- Used around the world
- Open source
    - Free as in beer
    - Free as in speach

## Packages

- First rule of programming
    - has someone else done it already?
- Packages are add ons to increase functionality
- Today we'll use
    - tidyverse: <https://www.tidyverse.org/>
    - igraph: <http://igraph.org/r/>


## R signposts

- `function()` Anything with brackets is a function, like a spreadsheet
- `%>%` A pipe can send output from a function to the next line
- `<-` and `=` can generally be used 
- `?function` brings up help menu


## Reading data

- *Where's my data?!*
- `read_csv("file_name")`
- `?read_csv`
- `read_excel()`
- assigned to:
    - `x = read_csv()` or `x <- read_csv()`
    - `read_csv() %>%`


## Selecting columns

- `select()`
- `select(data, column1, column2)`
- from a pipe:
    - `read_csv() %>% select(column1, column2)`


## Filtering by value

- `filter()`
- `filter(data, column1=="value")`
- `filter(data, column1!="value")`
- `filter(data, column2==10)`
- `filter(data, column2>10)`
- `filter(data, column1=="value" & column2>10)`


## Summarise

- `count()`
- `group_by() %>% summarise()`


## Graphs

- `ggplot(data, aes(x, y)`
